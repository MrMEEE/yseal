        <h1>The Legend of Yoel the ySEal</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">The Guardian of Security-Enhanced Systems</p>
    </div>

    <div class="story-content">
        <h2>🌊 Once Upon a Time in the Digital Ocean</h2>
        <p>
            In the vast digital ocean, where servers swam freely and data flowed like currents, there lived a young seal named <span class="emphasis">Yoel</span>. 
            Unlike other seals who spent their days playing in the waves, Yoel had a special gift – he could see the invisible shields that protected the digital world.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            These shields were called <span class="emphasis">SELinux policies</span>, and they were the guardians of security, keeping malicious intruders away from precious data. 
            But Yoel noticed something troubling...
        </p>

        <h2>⚠️ The Great Permissive Plague</h2>
        <p>
            One day, while swimming through the server farms, Yoel discovered a horrifying trend. Everywhere he looked, administrators were typing the dreaded command:
        </p>
        
        <div class="quote">
            "setenforce 0"<br>
            "SELINUX=permissive"
        </div>
        
        <p>
            The protective shields were being turned off! Yoel watched in dismay as one server after another dropped their defenses, leaving themselves vulnerable to attack. 
            When he asked why, the administrators would shrug and say:
        </p>
        
        <div class="quote">
            "It's too hard to configure..."<br>
            "We don't have time to write policies..."<br>
            "It keeps blocking our applications..."
        </div>

        <h2>😈 Enter the 0days</h2>
        <p>
            In the darkest corners of the digital ocean lurked the <span class="villain">Evil 0days</span> – malicious exploits that fed on unprotected systems. 
            They had been waiting for this moment. With SELinux disabled across the digital ocean, the 0days began their feast, compromising system after system.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Data was stolen. Services were hijacked. Chaos reigned supreme. And the 0days grew stronger with each conquest.
        </p>

        <div class="hero-action">
            💪 "NOT ON MY WATCH!" barked Yoel
        </div>

        <h2>🛡️ The Birth of ySEal</h2>
        <p>
            Yoel realized that sysadmins weren't lazy or careless – they simply didn't have the tools they needed! Writing SELinux policies from scratch was difficult and time-consuming. 
            There was no easy way to share and discover policies that others had already created.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            That's when inspiration struck like lightning ⚡
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <span class="emphasis">"If Ansible has Galaxy for sharing playbooks,"</span> Yoel thought, 
            <span class="emphasis">"why can't we have something similar for SELinux policies?"</span>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            And thus, <span class="emphasis">ySEal</span> was born! <strong>Y</strong>our <strong>S</strong>ecurity <strong>E</strong>nhanced <strong>A</strong>rchitecture <strong>L</strong>ibrary – 
            a place where system administrators could:
        </p>
        
        <ul style="margin-left: 40px; color: #444;">
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">📚 Discover pre-built SELinux policies for common applications</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">🤝 Share their own policies with the community</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">⭐ Rate and review policies based on effectiveness</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">🚀 Install policies with a single command</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">🔄 Track versions and updates effortlessly</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>🎉 The Victory</h2>
        <p>
            With ySEal swimming through the digital ocean, administrators started enabling SELinux again! They could find policies for Docker, for Nginx, for PostgreSQL, 
            and for hundreds of other applications – all tested and verified by the community.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The protective shields went back up, one server at a time. The Evil 0days, finding fewer and fewer vulnerable systems, retreated back to their dark corners, 
            defeated and hungry.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            And Yoel? He became known across the digital ocean as <span class="emphasis">Yoel the ySEal</span>, the Guardian of Security-Enhanced Systems. 
            He continues to patrol the servers to this day, ensuring that no system goes unprotected.
        </p>
